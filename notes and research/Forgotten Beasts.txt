Pick a form for the FB's name and generate the pieces as needed

Steps to create a FB:
  1:  Give it a Name
      Pick one of the four valid naming schemes (certain name might be more common. Don't worry about that yet)
        If the result is Xx, just use the regular naming function and give it a random language
  2:  Pick a body type
      Choose an animal or a form at random
      This may be dictated by desired difficulty level
  3:  Pick a quirk
      The body form is unusual in some drastic way. Maybe it's composed of a strange material or it has more or fewer body parts than normal
