When getName() is called from NameModule, it should not handle any of the name generation functions, only call the responsible functions.
In fact, getName shouldn't be a part of the module anyway since that function will be almost universal. 
All the module button needs to do is pass the current and previous token objects to the external getName() and wait on a response
Once a name object comes back, decide whether to update the name on state as per the user's settings

currentTokens: [
  ['earth', 'artifice'],
  ['evil', 'flowery', 'domestic']
]
previousTokens: [
  ['magic', 'holy'],
  ['flowery', 'death', 'subordinate']
]

Name Object: {
  // should name object be language agnostic?
  first: 'cave',
  last1: 'cloister',
  last2: 'spear'
}

              ------------------------
              RULES FOR CHOOSING NAMES
              ------------------------

First Names are always nouns
Second Names are always two-word pairs and can be any combination of word types
  Noun-Noun, Adjective-Noun, and Verb-Noun appear to be the most common

Each race has its own sphere of names to pick from. These spheres are listed in language_SYM and the sphere rules are listed in entity_default. 
Dwarves pick from the ARTIFICE and EARTH group (231 possible names?) and their last names avoid use of the FLOWERY (and other culled) group

TAKEN FROM THE WIKI
  Dwarf first names come from a combination of symbol sets as defined in the raw file language_SYM.txt.
  175 Dwarf names = (ARTIFICE ∪ EARTH) \ (DOMESTIC ∪ FLOWERY ∪ NEGATOR ∪ NEGATIVE ∪ UGLY ∪ EVIL) 
  First names also need to have [THE_NOUN_SING] in their language_words.txt entry. This filters out an additional 10, leaving a total of 165 valid names.[1]

  Epithets
    When a creature scores five notable kills (typically creatures belonging to a civilization, but also any creature that has scored a notable kill itself), it is given an epithet by its civilization. The epithet is most often two names, but can also occasionally be one, though each of these names can be a compound word. The words appear to be selected somewhat randomly, leading to epithets that translate as gibberish such as "the Hardy Ring-Cobra of Dashing". On occasion, the epithet can be surprisingly apt. The epithet is translated in the same places the creature's second name is translated.
  Animal and megabeast names
    Animals who are not pets can gain a name by acquiring notable kills or becoming an enemy of a civilization. The language of the animal's name is determined by the civilization that named it, though the relationship is not always straightforward--a wild crundle that kills an elven-named forgotten beast at a dwarven site may receive an elven name, for instance. Most animals who acquire a name in world generation do not ever acquire additional ones, though it is possible. Animals can acquire multiple names more frequently either in fortress mode by killing your dwarves, invaders, or uninvited guests, or in adventurer mode by killing your adventurers or members of their parties.
    Megabeasts acquire names in an unusual fashion. Unlike other creatures, they do not have a parent civilization. However, all megabeasts have at least one name and typically have more, up to four. Megabeasts appear to gain their original names from the first civilization they have contact with, and in most cases gain epithets from conflict with others. Megabeasts with only one or two names have likely led uneventful lives.
  Other names
    On occasion, your dwarves will decide to give names to the creatures inhabiting the area around a fortress. It appears that only creatures who can talk will get names; additionally, the creature must remain on the map for an extended period of time, usually limiting the namings to creatures that inhabit chasms, bottomless pits, underground rivers, and underground pools. However, any creature that can speak, such as a snailman who has become stuck in a ditch, can be given a name. Other than that, the impetus for naming creatures is murky. Some creatures are named after only a few seasons, while others may go unnamed for decades. It may be that a creature must be in the preferences of a dwarf to receive a name, or the naming may occur randomly.
    Trees near elven settlements may also be named, though this currently has no known effect.
