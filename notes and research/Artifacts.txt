Steps to create an artifact:
  1:  Get Artifact Name
      Pick from naming schemes
      Xx
      The Y Z (where Y is an Adjective and Z is a noun)
      The Y of Z
      X the Y of Z
  2:  Determine the base item
      Method A: Huge array of base items
        Pros: Simple, easy to read
        Cons: Completely random; Breastplates are just as common as toy anvils
      Method B: Workshop object with weighted values
        Pros: Can easily select item types by workshop and set percentages for each workshop
        Cons: More complex. Will require a lot more checking and setup
  3:  Determine the main material
      Any item can be made of any material (I think)
      Check to see if the material has a sub-type (bone vs dog bone / wood vs oak)
  4:  Determine the number of decorations and/or encrustings
      Must have at least one "It is decorated with" or "It is decorated with" phrase
