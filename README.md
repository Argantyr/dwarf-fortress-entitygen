### Dwarf Fortress Entity Generator  
This tool intends to replicate the random entity generation of Dwarf Fortress for use in Dwarf Fortress themed tabletop games.  
The end product should be able to replicate:
  - Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Goblins (complete)
  - Forgotten Beasts (in progress)
  - All names with and without honorifics
  - The X of Y names
  - Artifacts
  - Engravings
  - Books/Songs/Poetry (Names Only. I'm not crazy)
  - Instruments
  - Other things I hadn't considered
  - Syndromes
  - Deities  
  Users should be able to filter traits by biome and gender
