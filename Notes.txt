              RULES FOR CHOOSING NAMES
              ------------------------

First Names are always nouns
Second Names are always two-word pairs and can be any combination of word types
  Noun-Noun, Adjective-Noun, and Verb-Noun appear to be the most common

Each race has its own sphere of names to pick from. These spheres are listed in language_SYM and the sphere rules are listed in entity_default. 
Dwarves generally pick from the ARTIFICE and EARTH group (198 possible names) and their last names avoid use of the forbidden groups

ALL VALID TOKENS: "flowery", "nature", "primitive", "holy", "evil", "negator", "magic", "violent", "peace", "ugly", "death", "old", "subordinate", "leader", "new", "domestic", "mythic", "artifice", "color", 
                  "mystery", "negative", "romantic", "assertive", "aquatic", "protect", "restrain", "thought", "wild", "earth", "good", "balance", "boundary", "dance", "darkness", "light", "order", "festival", 
                  "family", "fire", "food", "freedom", "games", "luck", "music", "sky", "silence", "trade", "travel", "truth", "wealth"

DWARVES:
  PREFERRED:  "artifice", "earth"

              "trade", "travel", "truth", "wealth"
  FORBIDDEN:  "domestic", "subordinate", "evil", "flowery", "negative", "ugly", "negator"

HUMANS:
  PREFERRED:  none
  FORBIDDEN:  "subordinate", "evil", "negative", "ugly", "negator"

  RESEARCH :  A survey of 3829 dwarves in a newly-generated world yielded a pool of 249 unique names
              Out of 3829 generated dwarves, 89 had non-dwarven names
                Of these, 4 were Goblin and 85 were Human
              Chance of having a foreign name:  (2.32%)
              Chance of having a human name:    (2.22%)
              Chance of having a goblin name:   (0.1 %)
              Chance of having an elf name:     (0.0 %)
